DISEASE AND DISEASE TRANSMISSION

# Chapter 2 Disease and disease transmission


An enormous variety of organisms exist, including some which can survive and
even develop in the body of people or animals. If the organism can cause
infection, it is an infectious agent. In this manual infectious agents which cause
infection and illness are called pathogens. Diseases caused by pathogens, or the
toxins they produce, are communicable or infectious diseases [(45)] . In this manual
these will be called disease and infection.


This chapter presents the transmission cycle of disease with its different elements,
and categorises the different infections related to WES.

## **2.1 Introduction to the transmission cycle of disease**


To be able to persist or live on, pathogens must be able to leave an infected host,
survive transmission in the environment, enter a susceptible person or animal, and
develop and/or multiply in the newly infected host.


The transmission of pathogens from current to future host follows a repeating
cycle. This cycle can be simple, with a direct transmission from current to future
host, or complex, where transmission occurs through (multiple) intermediate
hosts or vectors.


This cycle is called the transmission cycle of disease, or transmission cycle. The
transmission cycle has different elements:


� The pathogen: the organism causing the infection

� The host: the infected person or animal ‘carrying’ the pathogen

� The exit: the method the pathogen uses to leave the body of the host

� Transmission: how the pathogen is transferred from host to susceptible person
or animal, which can include developmental stages in the environment, in
intermediate hosts, or in vectors

CONTROLLING AND PREVENTING DISEASE


� The environment: the environment in which transmission of the pathogen
takes place.

� The entry: the method the pathogen uses to enter the body of the susceptible
person or animal

� The susceptible person or animal: the potential future host who is receptive to
the pathogen


To understand why infections occur in a particular situation, and to know how to
prevent them, the transmission cycles of these infections must be understood. The
rest of this chapter looks at the elements of the transmission cycle in more detail.

DISEASE AND DISEASE TRANSMISSION

## **2.2 The pathogen**

The pathogen is the organism that causes the infection. [*] Specific pathogens cause
specific infections. Cholera is caused by the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_, for
example, and Leishmaniasis is caused by different species (spp.) of the protozoa
_Leishmania_ .


Specific infections also have specific transmission cycles. To be able to react
appropriately to health problems in a population, the specific infection causing the
problems must be known. Identification of the infection will usually be done by
medical personnel.


Different categories of pathogens can infect humans. The pathogens causing the
diseases covered in this manual include viruses, bacteria, rickettsiae, fungi, protozoa, and helminths (worms). All pathogens go through a lifecycle, which takes the
organism from reproducing adult to reproducing adult. This cycle includes phases
of growth, consolidation, change of structure, multiplication/reproduction, spread,
and infection of a new host. The combination of these phases is called the
development of the pathogen.


Two terms are commonly used to describe pathogens leaving the host through
faeces or urine: latency and persistence.


After excretion, a latent pathogen must develop in the environment or intermediate host before a susceptible person or animal can be infected. During the latent
period the pathogen is not infectious. A non-latent pathogen does not need to go
through a development, and can cause infection directly after being excreted.


Persistency describes how long a pathogen can survive in the environment. A
persistent pathogen remains viable for a long period outside the host (perhaps
months), while a non-persistent pathogen remains viable for only a limited period
(6) (days, or weeks).


Active immunity is the resistance the person or animal develops against the
pathogen after overcoming infection or through immunisation (vaccination). [(45)] .
Depending on the pathogen, the effectiveness of active immunity often decreases
over time.


- It is important to realise that not all infections will result in disease. While a pathogen may cause illness in one
person, it may be killed or cause asymptomatic infection in another.


9


CONTROLLING AND PREVENTING DISEASE


Usually immunity only develops against the specific pathogen that caused the
infection. If there are different types (serotypes or strains) of the same pathogen
(e.g. in dengue fever and scrub typhus), immunity will often only develop against
the particular type which caused the infection. The person or animal can still
develop the illness when infected with another serotype or strain of the pathogen [(3)] .


Table 2.1 presents the different categories of pathogenic organisms with some of
their characteristics, including latency, persistence, and immunity. The information is general, and exceptions can occur.

## **2.3 The host**


The host is the person or animal infected by the pathogen. The importance of the
host in the transmission cycle is its roles as both reservoir and source of patho
gens.


There are two types of host: definitive and intermediate host. The definitive host is
the person or animal infected with the adult, or sexual, form of the pathogen. In
the infections covered here, people are usually the definitive host. To keep things
simple the definitive host is called just ‘the host’.


The intermediate host is an animal or person infected by a larval, or asexual, form
of the pathogen [(3)] . Cysticercosis and hydatid disease are the only infections
covered here for which people are the intermediate host. Where intermediate host
is meant, this term is used. Of the infections covered here, only helminths have
both definitive and intermediate hosts. All other pathogens only have definitive
hosts, although vectors function technically as intermediate hosts for protozoa.


_**Zoonosis: transmission from animal to person**_
Some pathogens are specific to humans, others to animals. Many pathogens are
less specific and can infect both people and animals. Infections that can naturally
be transmitted from animal to person are called zoonoses [(3)] . Zoonoses are very
common; over half of the infections covered in this manual are zoonoses. Many of
these infections normally occur in an animal cycle, with people being infected by
chance.


The problem with zoonoses is that a continuous reservoir of pathogens exists
outside humans. Even if all human infections were cured and transmission to

people stopped, the presence of an animal reservoir would remain a continuous
risk to people.

n/a: Not applicable as the pathogens are not excreta-related.


11


CONTROLLING AND PREVENTING DISEASE


Prevention of zoonoses often includes control of animal hosts. This is possible by
reducing the number of hosts (e.g. controlling rats), immunising domestic animals, or avoiding unnecessary contact with host animals.


_**Carriers: hosts without obvious illness**_

A person or animal who develops an illness is an obvious example of a host. It is
very common, however,for infections to occur without the disease developing.
The person or animal infected can potentially spread the pathogen, but does not
show clear symptoms [(8)] . The symptoms may be mild, or may be completely
absent.


These hosts are called carriers, or asymptomatic carriers. Table 2.2 shows some
infections that are frequently mild or asymptomatic. The host can be infectious for
a short period in transient carriers, or over a prolonged period in a chronic
carrier [(3)] . Incubating carriers have been infected and can spread the pathogen, but
do not yet show the symptoms of the illness. Convalescent carriers continue to
spread the pathogen even though they have recovered from illness.


In many infections carriers play an important role in transmitting the pathogen. It
is usually not possible to identify asymptomatic carriers [(73)], and unless the family
and other close contacts of the sick person or even the whole population can be
treated, carriers will remain a threat to the health of those surrounding them.

DISEASE AND DISEASE TRANSMISSION


_**Other reservoirs of pathogens**_
Besides hosts, there are several other pathogen reservoirs that can play a role in
the transmission of disease. Some pathogens are very resistant, and can survive in
the environment for considerable time. Though this will normally be an exception, roundworm eggs can remain viable in soil for years [(3)] .


Intermediate hosts may be important reservoirs of pathogens, and several helminths
can even multiply in the intermediate host.


Vectors are usually infectious for life, and several pathogens can be transmitted to
the offspring of the vector over several generations [(2)] . A soft tick, for example, can
survive for more than five years and can pass to its offspring the pathogen which
causes tick-borne relapsing fever [(73)] .


Some pathogens can live their entire lifecycle outside the host. These include
threadworm and several faecal-oral bacteria which cause bacillary dysentery,
(para)typhoid, and salmonellosis [(3)] .


Animal hosts, asymptomatic carriers, and other potential reservoirs of pathogens
can be important sources of infection, and this must be taken into account when
trying to control disease. The whole population at risk may have to be treated, or
animal hosts controlled. With several diseases these preventive measures will
have to be maintained over a long period before a reduction in the occurrence of
the infection will be noticeable.

## **2.4 Transmission of disease**


To survive as a species, pathogens must infect new people or animals. To do this,
they must leave the body of the host, find their way to a new susceptible person or
animal, and enter the body of that person or animal. As the exit, transmission, and
entry of the pathogens are closely associated, we will cover them together.


Water and environmental sanitation interventions that aim to improve the health
of a population usually try to reduce the risk of transmission of infection. To do
this appropriately, the WES specialist needs to be familiar with the pathogens’
transmission route(s). It is this understanding that enables the specialist to determine which control measures will be most effective in a particular situation.


As many infections are linked to WES, it is useful to categorise the different
diseases.


13


CONTROLLING AND PREVENTING DISEASE


For a water and sanitation specialist the most useful categorisation is based on the
transmission cycles of the infections. Generally speaking, diseases with similar
transmission cycles can be controlled by similar preventive measures, and will
occur in similar environments.


The infections are categorised and their transmission routes described at the same
time. More information on the transmission routes and potentially effective
preventive measures of specific diseases can be found in Annexe 1.


Some terms relating to the transmission or classification of infections are defined
here:


**Food-borne infections:** infections which can be transmitted through eating food
containing the pathogen.


**Vector-borne infections:** infections transmitted through vectors. We use vectorborne infections only for infections with a _biological vector_, that is a vector in
which the pathogen goes through a development before further transmission is
possible (e.g. mosquitoes, tsetse fly, body louse). We do not classify as vectorborne those infections which are transmitted by _mechanical vectors_, that is the
animal is only a vehicle for transporting the pathogen (e.g. domestic flies,
cockroaches).


**Water-borne infections:** infections which can be transmitted through drinkingwater which contains the pathogen.


**Water-washed infections:** infections caused by pathogens whose transmission
can be prevented by improving personal hygiene.


Infections can have either direct or indirect transmission routes.


**2.4.1** **Infections with direct transmission**

A pathogen with a direct transmission route can infect a susceptible person or
animal immediately after leaving the host. The pathogen does not need to develop
in the environment, in an intermediate host, or in a vector.


In faecal pathogens these are the non-latent infectious agents.


This group contains three disease-groups: faecal-oral infections, leptospirosis,
and infections spread through direct contact.


14


DISEASE AND DISEASE TRANSMISSION


_**2.4.1.1**_ _**Faecal-oral infections**_

These pathogens leave the host through faeces, and enter the susceptible person or
animal through ingestion. Transmission occurs mainly through direct contact with
contaminated fingers; food contaminated directly with excreta, contaminated
hands, domestic flies, soil, or water; contaminated drinking-water; or contaminated soil. Faecal-oral infections are food-borne, water-borne, and water-washed.
As faecal-oral infections are transmitted directly, any route that will take matter
polluted with faeces directly or indirectly to somebody’s mouth could potentially
transmit the pathogen. Figure 2.2 shows some common transmission routes of
faecal-oral infections.


Some of these infections have mainly animal hosts, while others are limited to
humans. Faecal-oral infections include diarrhoeal diseases such as cholera and

bacillary dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis A, and poliomyelitis.















15


CONTROLLING AND PREVENTING DISEASE


_**2.4.1.2**_ _**Leptospirosis**_
The main reservoir of leptospirosis is normally rats, though many other animals
can potentially transmit the infection. The pathogen leaves the animal host
through urine. People are usually infected through direct skin contact with water,
moist soil, or vegetation contaminated with urine from infected animals. Other
ways of transmission are direct contact with body tissues of infected animals or
ingesting food contaminated with urine. Transmission from person to person is
rare [(3)] .


_**2.4.1.3**_ _**Infections of direct contact**_

All the diseases covered in this manual that fall into this category are infections
which affect the skin or eyes. Pathogens are present on the skin or in the
discharges of affected body parts or eyes. The pathogens are transmitted directly
through contaminated hands, clothes, domestic flies, or any other contaminated
material.


The pathogen enters the body through skin or mucous membranes such as the
eyes. These infections are associated with poor personal hygiene and are waterwashed.


Few of these infections have animal hosts. The diseases in this category include
conjunctivitis, trachoma, yaws, and scabies.


**2.4.2** **Infections with indirect transmission**

A pathogen with an indirect transmission route must go through a development
phase outside the host before it can infect a new susceptible person or animal. This
development will take place in a specific intermediate host, vector, or type of
environment.


This need to go through a particular organism or environment gives the transmission route a focus, which preventive measures can target, for example by vector
control or improved food preparation.


In the faecal pathogens these are the latent infectious agents.


The disease-groups with indirect transmission are soil-transmitted helminths,
water-based helminths, beef/pork tapeworm infection, Guinea-worm infection,
and vector-borne infections.


16


DISEASE AND DISEASE TRANSMISSION


_**2.4.2.1**_ _**Soil-transmitted helminths**_

These worms leave the body through faeces as eggs or larvae. After excretion they
have to develop in soil. They can be further divided based on how the pathogen
enters the human body.


**Entrance by penetration of the skin:** the pathogen enters the body through skin
which is in direct contact with contaminated soil. This is the method used by
hookworms and threadworms.


**Entrance by ingestion:** if either contaminated soil, or food or hands contaminated with polluted soil come into contact with the mouth, the pathogen can be
transmitted. These infections can be food-borne and water-washed. This method

is used by roundworms and whipworms.


The infections covered here do not have animal hosts. Figure 2.3 presents the
transmission routes of the soil-transmitted helminths.















17


CONTROLLING AND PREVENTING DISEASE


_**2.4.2.2**_ _**Water-based helminths**_

These pathogens leave the body through excreta. The infectious agents must
develop in intermediate hosts living in freshwater. The transmission of these
infections is therefore only possible if excreta containing the pathogens reaches
fresh surface water in which there are suitable intermediate host(s). Based on
transmission cycle, this category can be sub-divided in two groups:


**Schistosomiasis.** After excretion, the pathogen infects a freshwater snail, in
which it develops and multiplies. The snail releases the pathogens into the
water, and people are infected when these pathogens penetrate skin which is in
direct contact with infected freshwater. Only one type of schistosomiasis
(which occurs only in Asia) has an important reservoir in an animal host; all
other types have people as the only host of importance.


**Water-based helminths** with two water-based intermediate hosts. The first inter
mediate host is a freshwater snail or copepod. The second intermediate host is
a freshwater plant, fish, or crabs/crayfish. The intermediate hosts are specific to
the pathogen. These infections are food-borne and people become infected
when they eat the second intermediate host without properly cooking it. All
these infections affect both animals and people. These diseases include
opisthorchiasis, clonorchiasis, and lung fluke disease.


The transmission routes of the water-based helminths are presented in Figure 2.4.


_**2.4.2.3**_ _**Beef/pig tapeworm infection**_
The pathogens leave the person through faeces. The excreted eggs then have to be
ingested by either cattle or pigs. Once the pathogen is ingested by the animal, it
will develop in the body of the cow or pig. The infections are food-borne and
people become infected when they eat undercooked beef or pork containing the
pathogen. People are the only hosts to the infection.


A dangerous complication called cysticercosis is possible when people ingest the
eggs of the pig tapeworm. The pathogen will form cysts throughout the person’s
body. Transmission of this infection is like faecal-oral infections.


_**2.4.2.4**_ _**Guinea-worm**_

In this infection the pathogen, a large worm, creates a blister on the person’s skin,
which erupts when it comes into contact with water, releasing the worm’s larvae.
These larvae then infect a copepod ( _Cyclops_ ), in which it develops. The disease is
water-borne. People become infected by drinking water containing _Cyclops,_ and


18


DISEASE AND DISEASE TRANSMISSION









19


CONTROLLING AND PREVENTING DISEASE









are the only host to this infection. Figure 2.5 shows the transmission route of
Guinea-worm.


_**2.4.2.5**_ _**Vector-borne diseases**_

These infections are transmitted by vectors. Vectors are arthropods (insects, ticks,
or mites) which can transmit infections from host to future host [(73)] . The pathogen
exists in the blood or skin of the host. The vector becomes infected when it feeds

on a host. The pathogen develops and multiplies inside the vector, which then
becomes infectious. People are usually infected through the bite of an infectious
vector, though other ways of entry are possible. With several vector-borne diseases animal hosts are important reservoirs. Vector-borne diseases include yellow
fever, malaria, sleeping sickness, plague, epidemic louse-borne typhus fever, and
louse-borne relapsing fever.


20


DISEASE AND DISEASE TRANSMISSION

## **2.5 The environment**


The environment is everything that surrounds the pathogen in its transmission
from host to susceptible person or animal. Obviously the environment is a vast
subject, and we can only look at some of the more important environmental
factors here.


Interventions which involve WES will often modify the environment to try to
reduce the transmission risk.


The environmental factors that we will look at here are climate, landscape, human
surroundings, and human behaviour. Environmental factors are often associated,
for example higher altitudes result in lower temperatures, landscapes are formed
by the climate.


**2.5.1** **The climate**

The climate and its seasonal changes play an important role in disease transmission. The presence of vectors and intermediate hosts often depends on rain and
temperature.


The climatological requirements of the vector or intermediate hosts can predict
whether an infection is likely to be a problem in an area. Malaria, for example,
will normally not occur in temperatures below 16°C and infection is thus unlikely
at altitudes above 2,000 metres.


In general, direct sunlight, a dry environment, and high temperatures will reduce
the survival times of pathogens in the environment.


Conditions may not be suitable to transmission year round, and many infections
are seasonal, occurring when the environment is favourable to transmission.
Mosquito-borne infections, like malaria and yellow fever, are linked to the rainy
season [(16,44)] . The occurrence of diarrhoeal diseases often increases with the first

rains after the dry season, as faecal pollution is washed into rivers. Ponds which
disappear in the dry season may in the wet season contain water with snails that
will transmit schistosomiasis [(73)] .


The climate influences human behaviour. In cold climates people will crowd
together and wear more clothing. If this is combined with poor personal hygiene
the the body-louse, vector of louse-borne typhus fever and louse-borne relapsing
fever, can thrive.


21


CONTROLLING AND PREVENTING DISEASE


In warmer climates children are also likely to play in surface water, where they can
be infected with schistosomiasis.


**2.5.2** **The landscape**
The landscape consists of the larger physical structures in the environment. These
structures are usually natural, but can be man-made. They include mountains,
deserts, rivers, jungle, artificial water reservoirs, and deforested areas. Aspects of
the landscape that would influence disease transmission most are the microclimate, the presence of water, and types of vegetation.


Man-made modifications of the landscape often increase the risk of disease
transmission by creating a habitat favourable to vectors or intermediate hosts.
Large artificial water reservoirs frequently increase the occurrence of malaria and
schistosomiasis [(6)], for example, and introducing irrigation schemes can increase
the occurrence of schistosomiasis [(15)] .


Although the WES specialist working in the field must recognise the risk-factors
linked to the landscape, he or she will normally not be able to modify the
landscape to reduce the risks of disease transmission.


**2.5.3** **The human surroundings**
Landscape and human surroundings are closely linked, and it is difficult to divide
the two clearly. The difference is one of scale; while the landscape normally
cannot be modified or improved by individual people, individuals can modify the
human surroundings.


Although the landscape will normally be similar for all people living in an area,
the human surroundings may be very different for people living in the same
region, village, or even household. Many infections are linked to specific circumstances, and people with specific occupations, socio-economic status, gender, or
religion may be far more at risk than others. While the father of an African family
may be exposed to leptospirosis and plague because he works in sugarcane fields
and regularly traps rats, the mother may be exposed to sleeping sickness as she
goes to the river to wash clothes, and the children may be exposed to schistosomiasis while playing in the local pond.


The human surroundings are created by a combination of natural elements and
how people have modified these elements.


People adapt their surroundings to their needs. If these adaptations are well done,
they can help to prevent the transmission of disease. In practise they often


22


DISEASE AND DISEASE TRANSMISSION


encourage the transmission of disease, however, as people do not have the space,
motivation, understanding, time, energy, or financial or material means to do them
properly.


In relation to the WES aspects, human surroundings are concerned with water
supply, proper handling of excreta, removal of unwanted water, adequate management of solid waste, and control of vectors or intermediate hosts through modification of the environment or change in behaviour.


Waste products like excreta, wastewater, and refuse are disposed of in the human
surroundings. These wastes must be properly managed to prevent them becoming
a health risk.


The WES specialist working in the field will have to know what aspects of the
human surroundings increase the risk of disease transmission. This will enable
him or her to determine which aspects play an important role in the transmission
of disease in a specific situation. Based on this, an intervention can be planned
which will reduce the health risks to the population. More on the health risks
relating to the human surroundings, and the components from WES interventions
can be found in Chapter 5.


**2.5.4** **Human behaviour**

People behave in a certain way because they believe that they are making the most
of their lives. Human behaviour is complex. It is influenced by culture, for
example religion, attitudes, and traditional beliefs; by social position, such as
gender or age; by availability of means, for example money, energy, time, or
material; and by politics.


One type of handpump may be acceptable in one culture, but unacceptable in
another. One type of latrine may be preferred by men, while women or children
might prefer another. People may not accept things from a government they
despise, or from an insulting development worker.


Having access to a safe water supply, or technically adequate sanitation, does not
automatically mean people will use them [(25)] . If people do not regard structures as
acceptable, appropriate, or as an improvement to their quality of life, they will not
be used, or will not be used to their full potential.


Interventions that have only focused on structural improvements have often given
poor results in controlling infections. Studies in disease prevention indicate that
the most important factor in reducing the transmission of diseases related to WES


23


CONTROLLING AND PREVENTING DISEASE


is hygiene improvements resulting from changes in behaviour [(13)] . Changing
human behaviour in relation to WES should therefore be one of the priorities of
the WES specialist.


The specialist will have to identify existing behaviour, attitudes, and behaviour
concerning WES and their causes. This will form a base from which health and
hygiene promotion can be introduced. All interventions should look at human
behaviour, and where needed, reinforce existing positive behaviour while trying
to modify behaviour that favours disease transmission.

## **2.6 The future host**


The success of a pathogen in infecting a person will depend on:


� the infectious dose of the pathogen, and the number of infectious agents which
manage to enter the potential new host (this applies mainly to faecal-oral
infections); and

� whether the pathogen can overcome the barriers of the host.


These two factors are now considered in more detail.


**2.6.1** **The infectious dose**

The infectious dose is the number of pathogens which have to enter the body of a
susceptible person to cause infection. Although this figure should not be seen as
exact, it does give an indication of how easily an infection can occur.


The infectious dose is normally only used for faecal-oral infections. As every
larva of a helminth can become an adult worm, worms have a very low infectious
dose.


Table 2.3 gives the infectious doses of several faecal-oral infections.


Infections with a low infectious dose are more likely to be spread by direct personto-person contact than infections with a high infectious dose. Measures such as
improving drinking-water quality, or reducing the concentration of pathogens in
surface water (for exampleby treating sewage), are more likely to have effect on
infections with high infectious doses than on those with low ones [(73)] . Intuitively
one would say that flies are more likely to transmit infections with a low infectious dose, but this is complicated by the fact that several bacteria can multiply in
food, and thus reach the infectious dose in this way.


24


DISEASE AND DISEASE TRANSMISSION






|Table 2.3. Examples of infective doses of faecal-oral diseases|Col2|
|---|---|
|**_Disease_**|**_Infectious dose (in number of_**<br>**_pathogens)_**|
|Bacillary dysentery (shigellosis)(16)<br>Giardiasis(16)<br>Rotaviral enteritis(16)<br>Cholera(73)<br>Typhoid(73)|10 to 100<br>10 to 100<br>100 to 10,000<br>Usually 106 to 108<br>103 to 109|


**2.6.2** **The barriers of the body against pathogens**
The body has a range of mechanisms that prevent a pathogen from causing
infection.


The skin and mucous membranes have anti-microbial substances, and the stomach is acid to act as the first barriers against pathogens. Low acidity in the stomach
or an open wound (e.g. insect bite, cut, abrasion) can make this barrier ineffective.


The next barriers are mechanisms that react to the pathogen, and try to counter its
development. These barriers are not specific to the pathogen, and the body does
not need to have been in contact with the pathogen for them to be effective. These
mechanisms are the host’s resistance against pathogens [(41)] . Resistance is lowered
if someone is suffering from other infections [(73)], or is malnourished, stressed, or
fatigued [(41)] . Women have a higher risk of infection when pregnant [(73)] .


An individual’s immune system may have experienced a pathogen through an
earlier infection or immunisation (vaccination) with inactivated pathogens. When
the pathogens enter the person’s body, their immune system will recognise the
pathogen and make antibodies which will attack the pathogen. This is called
active immunity [(45)] . The effectiveness of active immunity depends on the pathogen, and the length of time since the body has been in contact with the pathogen.
Active immunity is effective only against that particular pathogen. The effectiveness against bacteria and viruses usually lasts for years [(3)] .


Passive immunity is created by introducing foreign antibodies into the body. An
unborn baby receives antibodies from the mother through the placenta, which will
protect it for some time after birth. Vaccination with antibodies is another way of
creating passive immunity [(73)] . The foreign antibodies will slowly disappear from
the body, and passive immunity will usually only last days or months [(3)] .


25


CONTROLLING AND PREVENTING DISEASE


A person or animal who lacks effective barriers (has a poor resistance and/or a low
immunity) against a pathogen is susceptible to this infectious agent [(45)] .


Two important practical points define the susceptibility of a population:


� A population that is weakened because of poor nutrition or a high occurrence
of disease, fatigue, or stress has an increased risk of disease.

� When a pathogen is very common in a population, or the population is
immunised, most people will have some form of immunity against it. In this
case the disease will attack mainly children. If the same pathogen is introduced
into a population which has low immunity, there is a risk of an outbreak (an
epidemic) which can attack all ages.


**2.6.3** **The infection over time**

When a pathogen is introduced in sufficient numbers, and overcomes the resistance and immune system of a person or animal, infection will follow. The time
between entrance of pathogen and appearance of the first signs of disease or
symptoms is called the incubation period. As mentioned earlier, not all infections
will result in disease, and for many infections asymptomatic carriers are common.

DISEASE AND DISEASE TRANSMISSION


The period of communicability is the period in which the host is infectious, or the
period in which pathogens are shed in the environment. The time between
entrance of pathogen and the onset of communicability is the latent period. This is
shown on a timeline in Figure 2.6.


In some infections the period of communicability starts before illness is apparent.
Hosts who can transmit the pathogen before showing symptoms are called incubating carriers. If the period of communicability extends beyond the end of the
illness, the hosts are called convalescent carriers.
